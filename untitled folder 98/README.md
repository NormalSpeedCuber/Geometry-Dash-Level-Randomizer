# Geometry Dash Level Randomizer (GDLR)

Hello everyone!

This is Geometry Dash Level Randomizer (GDLR)! It is a flask project for randomizing geometry dash levels.

## Example Usage:

When you run the "main.py" file, it will output something like this:


```
* Serving Flask app 'main'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with watchdog (fsevents)
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 106-589-578
 ```

When you run it, click or copy and paste the URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000) into your browser, in which you will find... My randomizer!

Click on the "Randomize Again" button to start using my randomizer, the randomizer has three variables:

1. **Difficulty**: This is the difficulty of the level, for example: "Harder" or "Insane Demon".
2. **Page**: The page where the level is.
3. **Number**: Where the level is in the page, for example:

```
Difficulty: Easy Demon
Page: 1
Number: 1
```

This would lead you to "The Nightmare" since it is the (1)st level on the (1)st page of the easy demon levels.

## IMPORTANT

If you don't already have python installed:

* **For windows**, run "**for_windows_users.bat**"
* **For MacOS/Linux**, run "**for_macos_linux_users.sh**"

If some of the .bat/.sh files don't work, install python 3.11.4 manually using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/

Thanks for using GDLR!
